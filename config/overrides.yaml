# Endpoint overrides for platform-core
#
# Use this to keep capability contracts portable (often `http://localhost:<port>`)
# while allowing the platform gateway (running in a container) to reach services.
#
# Common demo pattern:
# - Capabilities expose ports on the host
# - Platform runs in a container
# - Platform reaches host ports via host.containers.internal
